# ðŸ§± Maven Market: dbt Data Pipeline Project

A production-grade dbt project that transforms raw e-commerce data into validated, analytics-ready models in BigQuery. Built for scalable analytics, governed development, and clear business reporting.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project models data from Maven Market â€” a fictional retail platform â€” using dbt Cloud and BigQuery. It follows modern data engineering best practices:

- Modular SQL models (staging, marts)
- Semantic Git versioning and branching
- Row-level validation using data quality flags
- Centralized schema testing and documentation

All models are version-controlled in GitHub, developed in dbt Cloud, and deployed to BigQuery.

âœ… Key Features

    Staging Layer (stg_*)

        Standardizes formats (dates, text, numeric)

        Handles parsing (e.g. "45K" â†’ 45000)

        Adds dq_flag column for row-level data quality status

        Applies BigQuery-friendly typecasting for downstream use

    Schema Validation

        Uses dbt tests for not null and unique constraints

        All models documented via schema.yml

    Git Workflow

        Feature branches for each model (e.g. feature/stg-products)

        Semantic commit messages (feat:, chore:, etc.)

        Pull Requests into main for review and version history
