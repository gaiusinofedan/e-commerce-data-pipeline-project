# ðŸ§± Maven Market: dbt Data Pipeline Project

A production-grade dbt project that transforms raw e-commerce data into validated, analytics-ready models in BigQuery. Built for scalable analytics, governed development, and clear business reporting.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project models data from Maven Market â€” a fictional retail platform â€” using dbt Cloud and BigQuery. It follows modern data engineering best practices:

- Modular SQL models (`staging`, `marts`)
- Semantic Git versioning and branching
- Row-level validation using data quality flags
- Centralized schema testing and documentation

All models are version-controlled in GitHub, developed in dbt Cloud, and deployed to BigQuery.
